    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I'm excited to share my journey into web development with you. This is my very first portfolio website, and I'm building it step by step to showcase what I'm learning about HTML, CSS, and web technologies.</p>
    
    <h2>About My Learning Journey</h2>
    
    <p>Starting from the basics, I'm discovering how powerful and creative web development can be. Every line of code teaches me something new, and every project brings new challenges that help me grow as a developer.</p>
    
    <p>This portfolio represents not just my technical skills, but also my dedication to continuous learning and improvement. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, so I'm building real projects that solve real problems.</p>
    
    <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
    
    <p>As I continue to develop my skills, this portfolio will evolve to include more sophisticated projects, better design, and enhanced functionality. I'm committed to documenting my progress and sharing the knowledge I gain along the way.</p>
